# hello-Graph
objective is to read a text/csv file containing graph description and find all the disjoint cycles in it.

The graph data is in samplegraph.txt

Follow the following steps  
 (i) Compile ReadGraph.java
 (ii) Compile ComputeClear.java
 (iii) Compile and run Main.java
 
 use samplegraph.txt as the input file to test.
 You will find the adjacency list as of now.
 
 Note the code is not complete & still under test/development phase
